# comparison
Web Page to compare image between NWP (WRF) model forecast derived by different global models (GFS, UM).

This web page main purpose is to compare NWP (WRF) forecast image (rainfall plot, wind barb, temperature etc) between WRF forecast derived by different global model (GFS, UM etc) and also to compare the forecast with observation plot (RADAR etc). Beside that, this web also act as platform for additional NWP-derived products such as time-lagged ensemble plot, heat map etc. Advantages:
- two axes movement 
-- time axis 
-- valid time axis
- more than one level of wind overlay
